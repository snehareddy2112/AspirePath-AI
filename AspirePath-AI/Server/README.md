## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB database
- Gmail account for email services

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

server/.env

# --------------------
# Backend
# --------------------

### 👉 Replace the placeholders (your_xxx_here) with your actual keys when running locally.

```env
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
MAIL_USER=your_email_here
MAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password_here
RAPID_API_KEY=your_rapid_api_key_here
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### Database Connection

The server automatically connects to MongoDB when the `MONGO_URI` environment variable is available. PDF routes will work without database connection for testing purposes.

## 📊 API Documentation

### Request Format

All API requests should include:
